# --malloc_stats

## Description
This command executes the `malloc_stats()` function, which is a standard C library function (often part of `malloc.h` in GNU systems or similar in other libc implementations). It prints detailed statistics about the dynamic memory allocation performed by the `malloc` subsystem to standard output. These statistics are useful for developers to understand memory usage patterns, diagnose memory leaks, or analyze memory fragmentation within the VeloCloud Edge process.

The output typically includes information about:
*   Total memory allocated.
*   Memory currently in use.
*   Number of allocated blocks.
*   Free memory available in different allocation pools or arenas.

## Arguments
This command takes no arguments.

## Example Usage
```
example_com:velocli> debug --malloc_stats
```
*(Note: The actual output of `malloc_stats` can be quite verbose and its format is dependent on the underlying memory allocator implementation used by the system. It will be printed directly to the console after executing the command.)*

## Field Descriptions
The output of `debug --malloc_stats` is directly from the system's `malloc_stats()` function. The specific fields and their meanings depend on the C library's memory allocator implementation (e.g., ptmalloc, jemalloc, tcmalloc). Generally, the output provides insights into:

| Category          | Description                                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arenas            | Memory allocation areas, often per-thread to reduce contention.                  |
| Mmapped regions   | Memory allocated directly from the OS using `mmap`.                              |
| Chunks/Blocks     | Individual pieces of allocated or free memory.                                   |
| In-use bytes      | Total bytes currently allocated and used by the application.                     |
| Free bytes        | Total bytes currently free and available for future allocations.                 |
| System bytes      | Total bytes obtained from the operating system by the allocator.                 |
| Overhead          | Memory used by the allocator itself for bookkeeping and metadata.                |
| Fastbins/Bins     | Data structures used by the allocator to manage free blocks of specific sizes.   |
