#	--per_peer_debug [clear | <any|cookie> <sip> <dip>]

##	Description
Enable per-peer debugging for a given cookie (hexadecimal flow identifier) and endpoint (source and destination IP pair), or disable all per-peer debugging with the `clear` command. Enabling this feature allows for more verbose logging of specific traffic flows, which is useful for detailed troubleshooting of packet forwarding and processing issues on the VeloCloud Edge.

##  Arguments
The command takes one of two forms for its arguments:
1.  `clear` to disable debugging.
2.  `<any|cookie> <sip> <dip>` to enable debugging for a specific flow.

| Argument       | Description                                                                                                                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `clear`        | If this is the first argument after `--per_peer_debug`, it disables all currently active per-peer debugging sessions. No further arguments are needed. |
| `<any|cookie>` | If `clear` is not used, this is the first argument. It specifies the flow to debug: <br> - `<cookie>`: A specific cookie value in hexadecimal format (e.g., `0xabcdef01`) identifying the flow. <br> - `any`: A keyword to match any cookie for the specified `<sip>` and `<dip>`. <br> This argument requires `<sip>` and `<dip>` to follow. |
| `<sip>`        | The source IP address of the traffic flow (e.g., `192.168.1.100`). Required if `<any|cookie>` is specified.                               |
| `<dip>`        | The destination IP address of the traffic flow (e.g., `8.8.8.8`). Required if `<any|cookie>` is specified.                                 |

##  Example Usage
To enable per-peer debugging for a specific flow identified by a cookie:
```
example_com:velocli> debug --per_peer_debug 0xabcdef01 192.168.1.100 8.8.8.8
```
*(This command enables verbose logging for the matching flow. Output is found in system logs.)*

To enable per-peer debugging for all flows between a specific source and destination IP:
```
example_com:velocli> debug --per_peer_debug any 192.168.1.100 10.10.10.5
```
*(This command enables verbose logging for all flows matching the SIP/DIP. Output is found in system logs.)*

To disable all active per-peer debugging:
```
example_com:velocli> debug --per_peer_debug clear
```
*(This command disables previously enabled per-peer debugging.)*

If insufficient arguments are provided:
```
example_com:velocli> debug --per_peer_debug
Insufficient Arguments. Refer --help.
```

##  Field Descriptions
This command does not produce tabular output directly to the console. Its primary effect is to toggle a debugging flag that increases the verbosity of logs for the specified network flow(s).

*   **Cookie**: An internal hexadecimal identifier used by the VeloCloud Edge dataplane to track individual traffic flows or sessions.
*   **Debug Output**: The detailed debugging information generated by this command can typically be found in the system logs of the VeloCloud Edge (e.g., `edged.log` or other diagnostic files). Consult the VeloCloud documentation for specific log locations and analysis techniques.
